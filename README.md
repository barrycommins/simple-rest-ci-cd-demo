Example code to demonstrate a simple rest service using CI/CD

Uses open source tools to build, test, analyse and deploy a simple service:

TravisCI for builds
Codacy for code quality
Coverity for static analysis
Coveralls for code coverage

and finally automatically deploys to 
Pivotal Cloud Foundry
